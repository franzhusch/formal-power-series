# Exploration of a Formalization a small Write Up

The write up is about formal power series and defining a ring homomorphism between formal power series and locally smooth functions at 0.

1. Run

   Aristotle could formalize a lot of the contents and it looks all correct to me. So a pretty good oneshot. Downside, it ran out of budget for that run so I started a second run. Interestingly he disproved the injectivity of phi, via some different proof instead of using the counterexample that I had used.

2. Run

   I just provided the unfinished file and the .tex file again and he didnt finish proving the surjectivity of phi via borels lemma.

Overall a good first impression of Aristotle, also the thought that it just continuously improves over time is very promising.

Downside is that it quite takes some time so the iterative process is very limited.
